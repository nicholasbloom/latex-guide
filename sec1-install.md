## <a id="setup"></a>Preface - Setup 

Before we begin, you'll probably need to install some things on your computer. So let's walk through the following steps:

1. [Opening the Terminal](#term)
2. [Choosing a text editor](#text)
3. [Installing LaTeX](#install)
4. [Creating a folder for your TeX files](#folder)

### <a id="term"></a>Opening the Terminal

In the Finder, get to your Applications folder. Inside it, you should see another folder called 'Utilities'.  Within that folder, click on the Terminal. For an easier way, just press âŒ˜Space, which will open Spotlight. Then type `Terminal', and it'll appear before your eyes. Keep it open for now, you'll need it later.

### <a id="text"></a>Choosing a Text Editor

As as far as text editors go, your choices are essentially infinite. On OS X, you can simply use the native text editor Apple gives you, Text Edit. But, like everyone else, I'm biased. I personally use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), but there are many more available. 

For something simple and easy to drop in to, try [Smultron](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smultron-4/id450194894?mt=12).  For something slightly more customizable (and scary), check out (in order of scariness): [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html?utm_source=thedeck&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=bbedit), [vim](http://www.vim.org/), and [Emacs](http://emacsformacosx.com), though there are many more.


### <a id="install"></a>Installing LaTeX 

LaTeX is fairly easy to install. TUG (TeX Users Group) creates special installation packages for each operating system. You can download the Mac-specific installer (called MacTeX) via [this](http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.pkg) direct link. Once the download finishes, double click the installer, and follow the instructions. The installer will tell you when you're all set.

**[NB] The Install Location** 

LaTeX installs inside the root folder of your hard drive. If you're running Mac OS 10.6 or later, you won't be able to see the install location. You can fix this by going back to the Terminal, and typing the following command:

    sudo chflags nohidden /usr
    killall Finder

Hit enter - you'll have to type in your administrator password, because 'sudo' means "run this command as an administrator." Once you do this, you can navigate to your your `/usr` folder - but we don't need that for now, so we'll get to it when we need it.

#### Changing Your Path

Okay, this next part is a little bit tricky. To briefly explain, you need to tell Terminal to look in the right places for the commands you're going to use. So, to do that, it takes a few steps.

**Step 1 - Cut a Hole in the Box**

Open the Terminal and paste this in:

    sudo defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
    killall Finder

Hit enter  - type your password again. *A lot* of files probably showed up in the Finder - that's fine, because you'll hide them in a minute.

**Step 2 - Put Your Stuff in that Box**

Open your text editor of choice. Make sure it's in **plain text** format, and copy/paste this in:

    export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/universal-darwin:$PATH

Then, save it in your home folder as '.profile' - **[NB]** *make sure* your save it with the period at the beginning and no extension on the end (you may have to uncheck the box if you're using Text Edit). It should look like this:

![save screen](Screen%20Shot%202012-07-20%20at%2010.18.15%20PM.png)

**Step 3 - Make It Open That Box**

Once it's saved, quit Terminal and restart it. It should look like this: 

![title](Screen%20Shot%202012-07-20%20at%2010.29.39%20PM.png)

 If it looks like that, you're ready to go. Just for fun type in `xetex` and hit enter. It should say:
 
 `This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.4-0.9998 (TeX Live 2012)
 restricted \write18 enabled.`
 
 If it does, you're all set. Just press 'x' and hit enter to quit out of XeTeX. You're almost ready to start typesetting!
 
 ### <a id="folder"></a>Creating a Folder for Your Documents
 
 When LaTeX typesets your documents, it creates a number of temporary files (such as yourdocument.aux, yourdocument.bcf, etc.). You don't really need these, and you probably don't want these sitting on your desktop, so it's best to create a folder specifically for them. I call mine 'Manuscripts'.

Note that once you've created a folder, you'll want to change the Terminal's "working directory," which is the folder the Terminal looks in for files to do things with. To do this open the Terminal and then type `cd` and then the path to the file. So if my home folder was called USER, and my LaTeX folder was inside my documents folder and called "LaTeX", I'd type:

    cd "~/Documents/LaTeX/"

On a Mac, "~" just means "home directory," which is shorter than typing USER every time. Now you're all set up and ready to get started.
