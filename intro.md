# A Guide to LaTeX  on the Mac - for Complete Beginners

LaTeX (pronounced Lay-tech) is a way to turn your papers into finished documents. It's a powerful typesetting application, which means it takes words and code that you input, and creates an attractive-looking manuscript. Think of it as a replacement for Microsoft Word. 

Once you learn how to use it, LaTeX can make complicated writing academic articles, book chapters, and dissertations much, much easier. It takes a bit of time to get used to, and can be kind of intimidating, but I think it's worth it. Once you take the time to learn it, it pays its dividends in times saved.

This guide is a (hopefully) easy-to-understand, concise guide to dropping in to LaTeX on a Mac. To get started, check out the tables below.
